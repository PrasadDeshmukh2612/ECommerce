# ECommerce (Shopping App)

This app is written in Kotlin, MVVM architecture with repository pattern and Dagger/Hilt for dependency injection

For networking purpose I have used retrofit library and asynchronous operations are handled by coroutines.

Glide is used for loading images and livedata, view model are some of the jetpack components and a hetrogeneous recyclerview is being used for development of this app.

Kotlin higher order functions and scope functions are used for writing concise code.
